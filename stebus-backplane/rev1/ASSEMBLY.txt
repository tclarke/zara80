Assembly is fairly straighforward except for the items mentioned in the
errata. The ibom html file is interactive. You can check the items when
they are ordered and there's a second check when they are installed. Mouse
over an item to highlight it on the PCB display.

1. Install the regulator (U101) first. It's fairly easy to hand solder. I'd
suggest using a small jumper (a cut-off tail from a resistor works well) to
connect pins 1 and 3. Then melt a little solder onto the three pads. Add some
flux. Rotate the part slightly to pin 2 is on pad 2 and pin 5 is on pad 3. You
should be able to easily attach those two pins by re-melting the solder.
Finally, solder pad 1 to the pin 1 and jumper section. Just melt a decent blob
of solder on to it and everything should flow together.

2. Install the diodes (D101-D106). The line on the diode corresponds to the
line on the silkscreen.

3. Install the resistors (R101-R104)

4. Install the resitor networks. (RN101-RN106)

5. Install the transistor if you're planning on using ATNRQ0 for power fail.

6. Install the capacitors (C101-C111). I usually do the ceramics first then
the larger electrolytics.

7. Install the DIN connectors (J101-J107) one at a time. I tack the top and
bottom pins then just go down one side and up the other.

8. Install the Molex power connector (J105). Use enough solder and give it a
few seconds to flow properly as these are large pins.

9. Install the pin header (J104) on the pack of the board. You can safely
install it on the front if you prefer but it's easier to connect on the back.

10. Tone out the power rails by touching to the various ATX power pins with
one probe and the back of the DIN connectors. Make sure the power rails and
the GND pins are connected properly. At this point it's safe to plug in an ATX
supply.

11. Short J104 and make sure the power supply is active. This usually turns on
a status light and spins up the fan.

12. Test the power rails on the back of the DIN connectors.
