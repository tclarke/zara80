<p><B>IEEE Standards </B>documents are developed within the Technical Committees of the IEEE Societies
and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Board. Members of the committees
serve voluntarily and without compensation. They are not necessarily

standard.</p>

<p>Use of an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. The existence of an IEEE
Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce,
test, measure, purchase, market, or provide other goods and services
related to the scope of the IEEE Standard. Furthermore, the viewpoint
expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subject to
change brought about through developments in the state of the art and
comments received from users of the standard. Every IEEE Standard is
subjected to review at least once every five years for revision or
reaffirmation. When a document is more than five years old, and has
not been reaffirmed, it is reasonable to conclude that its contents,
although still of some value, do not wholly reflect the present state
of the art. Users are cautioned to check to determine that they have
the latest edition of any IEEE Standard.</p>

<p>Comments for revision of IEEE Standards are welcome from any interested party,

<p>Interpretations: Occasionally questions may arise regarding the meaning of portions of
standards as they relate to specific applications. When the need for
interpretations is brought to the attention of IEEE, the Institute
will initiate action to prepare appropriate responses. Since IEEE
Standards represent a consensus of all concerned interests, it is
important to ensure that any interpretation has also received the

<a name="Foreword"><h1>Foreword</h1>


<p>(This Foreword is not a part of ANSI/IEEE Std 1000-1987, IEEE Standard for
an 8-Bit Backplane Interface: STEbus.)</p>

<p>The initial concept for STEbus was to produce a European version of the
STD Bus using the Eurocard form factor with the DIN41612 connector. From that concept STE became known as STD-European.</p>

<p>When IEEE formed Working Group P1000 the brief specified a Standard 8-Bit
Backplane Interface. At the inaugural meeting of Working Group P1000
it quickly became apparent that the opportunity was there to create a
completely new, modern, high-performance 8-Bit bus, and all ideas of
merely repinning the old STD Bus were rapidly forgotten.</p>

<p>At the initial meeting of P1000 it was decided that the bus should be a
part of the same family as VMEbus and Futurebus and as such should be
an asynchronous bus with multimaster capability. Today it is often
referred to as the baby brother of VMEbus. Unlike VMEbus though it
was to be processor and manufacturer independent. This has proven to
be an excellent decision as today there are many varied types of
processor available on STEbus, from microcontrollers such as 8031,
through Intel&rsquo;s 8085, 8088, and 80188; National Semiconductor&rsquo;s
32008 and 32016; Motorola&rsquo;s 6809, 68000, and 68008; Zilog&rsquo;s
Z80 and Z280; Hitachi&rsquo;s 64180, and the Inmos Transputer with
the promise of more to come.</p>

<p>A presentation was made to a packed audience at the IEE in London,
England in early 1983. It met with critical acclaim. The first
article about STEbus was also published about this time in an
international magazine (EDN May 26, 1983).</p>

<p>Work continued internationally and in late 1984 Draft D3.1 was produced.
This draft eradicated the daisy-chain bus request mechanism of D2.0
in favor of a simple solution that allowed position independence of
cards in the rack.</p>

<p>This was the first firm specification and encouraged more manufacturers to
look at the bus seriously. Among them were BICC-Vero, a major
manufacturer of Eurocard enclosures and backplanes, and British
Telecom, the UK's Telephone Utility. Market ground zero was early
1985 and since this time the number of manufacturers has continued to
grow from 18 companies in Spring 1986 to more than 30 in mid-1987,
with over 700 products available.</p>

<p>Much credit and praise is due Tim Elsmore who first conceived the idea for
STEbus during his employment with GMT Electronic Systems Ltd. Paul
Borrill was instrumental in negotiating with IEEE the formation of
Working Group P1000 and Bill Shields was appointed Chairman.</p>

Standards Committee. At the time of approval of this standard the

<hr size="1">

<a name="1"><h1>1. General</h1>

<a name="1.1"><h2>1.1 Scope</h2>

<p>The overall level of performance that may be achieved by any computer
system is determined, in large part, by the system bus that is used
to effect communication between the various system elements. System
performance characteristics, measured in terms of speed, reliability,
suitability to a variety of purposes, and adaptability to changing
technology are ultimately dependent on the particular bus structure
that is used and its associated protocols.</p>

<p>This standard defines the IEEE Std 1000 Bus, which may be used to
implement general purpose, high-performance 8-bit microcomputer
systems. Such a system may be used in a stand-alone configuration, or
in larger multiple-bus architectures, as a private (or secondary) bus
or a high-speed I/O channel. This standard is applicable to those
systems and system elements with the common commercial designation
STE Bus. It is intended for those users who plan to evaluate,
implement, or design various system elements that are compatible with
the IEEE 1000 Std Bus system structure.</p>

<p>The physical attributes and method of interconnect utilized by boards and
modules conforming to this standard are derived from several
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. These
standards, when implemented jointly in a systems environment, result
in a mechanical configuration commonly referred to as <I>Eurocard</I>.
Appendix B lists such applicable standards which, where referenced,
are considered as if incorporated with this standard. In particular
the connector used by IEEE Std 1000 Bus boards is a 64-pin male
connector utilizing the outside two rows (designated a and c rows),
specified in IEC Publication 603-2,1
and the mating female connector is used on IEEE Std 1000 Bus
backplanes. The recommended size for IEEE Std 1000 Bus boards is 100
mm &times; 160&nbsp;mm (3.937 in &times; 6.299 in), commonly referred to as a <I>single
height standard depth </I>Eurocard.</p>

<p>The IEEE Std 1000 Bus structure is based on the master-slave concept in
which a master, having gained control of the bus, may address and
command slaves. Masters and slaves communicate with each other by use
of an asynchronous interlocked handshake protocol. This technique
allows for the construction of computer systems that incorporate
devices of widely varying speeds. Multiple masters may be implemented
within a single system.</p>

<p>IEC publications are available from the Sales Department, American
National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018.</p>

<p>Two independent address spaces are supported: memory and I/O. Memory
transactions reference a 1 megabyte physical address space, while I/O
transactions reference a 4 kilobyte physical address space. System
integrity during all such transactions is enhanced by provision of a
transfer error signal.</p>

<p>Provision is made for interboard condition alerts such as interrupt requests,
DMA requests, system-specific error conditions, or other specialized
status conditions. Within this scheme eight prioritized attention
request levels, each with vectored response capability, are available
for user assignation.</p>

<p>This standard deals only with those characteristics that must be specified
so as to ensure the successful design and implementation of
compatible boards and systems. Issues relating to individual design
specifications, and performance or safety requirements are not
addressed.</p>

<a name="1.2"><h2>1.2 Features</h2>

<a name="1.4.3"><h3>1.4.3 Generic Signal Names</h3>

<p>Throughout
this standard bus request and acknowledge signals and attention
request signals are sometimes referred to as BUSRQ<I>n</I>*,
BUSAK<I>n</I>*,
and ATNRQn* respectively. Such general references are equivalent to specific references BUSRQ0*
or BUSRQ1* etc.</p>

<a name="1.4.4"><h3>1.4.4 Notation for Bus Signals</h3>

<p>Throughout this standard signals on a particular bus are referred to
collectively using the form A [19..0]. This notation should be taken as an abbreviation of all of the
address bus signals from A19 through to A0 inclusive.</p>

<p>In addition to the address bus signals, the notation is also used for
the data lines (for example, D[7..0]),
the common lines (for example, CM[2..0]),
the attention request lines (for example, ATNRQ[7..0]*),
the bus request lines (for example, BUSRQ[1..0]*)
and the bus acknowledge lines (for example, BUSAK[1..0]*).</p>

<a name="1.5"><h2>1.5 Logical and Electrical State Relationships</h2>

<p>Throughout this standard the term <I>asserted</I> is used to indicate
the logical true state of the particular signal referenced.</p>

<p>The corresponding term <I>negated</I>, however, is not used because it comprises a potentially ambiguous
representation when describing signals, which may be low or high true.</p>

<p>All signals that are low in their asserted state are designated by a
star (asterisk), which follows the signal name (for example,
ADRSTB*). The correlation between the terms true:false, high:low, and
asserted:released is demonstrated in the following table, utilizing
the signals ADRSTB* and CM[2..0] as an example.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Electrical</th><th>Logical</th><th>State</th></tr>

<a name="2"><h1>2. Functional Description</h1>

<p>This section describes the functional elements of IEEE Std 1000 Bus
interface. They are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>System Controller</p></li>
<li><p>Arbiter</p></li>
<li><p>Masters</p></li>
<li><p>Slaves</p></li>
</ol>

<p>An individual board attached to IEEE Std 1000 Bus backplane may consist
of one or more of these elements.</p>

<a name="2.1"><h2>2.1 System Controller</h2>

<p>Within any IEEE Std 1000 Bus system there shall be one, and only one, system
controller. The system controller provides essential facilities for
the proper operation of IEEE Std 1000 Bus systems. The system
controller may be combined on a board with a master.</p>

<p>The system controller shall provide as a minimum the following requirements:</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>SYSCLK.	A general-purpose clock signal in accordance with the specifications
	detailed in Section 3 of this standard.</p>

<LI><p>SYSRST*. An initial power-on system reset signal in accordance with
	the specifications detailed in Section 3 of this standard.</p>

<LI><p>TFRERR*. A transfer error signal in accordance with the
	specifications detailed in Section 3 of this standard.</p>

</OL>

<a name="2.2"><h2>2.2 Arbiter</h2>

<p>All bus allocation grants shall be provided by the arbiter in accordance
with the protocol described in Section 4 of this standard. There
shall be one, and only one, arbiter within any IEEE Std 1000 Bus
system. The arbiter may be combined on a board with a master.</p>

<a name="2.3"><h2>2.3 Masters</h2>

<p>A master is a board that is capable of controlling the transfer of data
on the bus, by means of the protocols defined in Sections 4 and 5 of
this standard. A master may contain a central processing unit (CPU)
or logic necessary to transfer data over the bus (for example, DMA
controller).</p>

<a name="2.3.1"><h3>2.3.1 Master Types</h3>


<p>All masters must request allocation of IEEE Std 1000 Bus from the arbiter
before they can control data transfers except in the special case of
a default master.</p>

<p><B>Default master.</B> 
A master that is allocated control of the bus by the arbiter whenever the bus
is not in use by another master. A default master is necessarily
combined with the arbiter on the same board and has the lowest
priority for bus allocation. There can be only one default master
within a IEEE Std 1000 Bus system, though a IEEE Std 1000 Bus system
need not include a default master.</p>

<p>All other masters (termed potential masters) request allocation of bus
control from the arbiter. This request shall be made by asserting one
of the two bus request (BUSRQ<I>n</I>*)
lines, or in the case of a master that is on the same board as the
arbiter but is not configured as a default master, by asserting a
third bus request line that is private to that board.</p>

<p>Multiple masters may exist within a system. The master's priority for bus
control allocation and the means by which such allocation is
accomplished are as described in Section 4.</p>

<a name="2.3.2"><h3>2.3.2 Master Modes</h3>

<p>Masters may retain control for a period of time constrained only by the
specific system requirements. Two modes of operation may be used by masters.</p>

<ol>

<li><p><I>Release-When-Done</I>. The master retains control of the bus until all desired transfers
have been accomplished.</p></li>

<li><p><I>Release-On-Request</I>. The master retains control of the bus indefinitely, relinquishing
control when it determines that another master requires allocation of
the bus. This determination may be made by several methods including
receipt of an attention request signal, hardware polling, or by
detection of a BUSRQ<I>n</I> signal becoming active.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>NOTE &mdash; By definition a default master always operates in release-on-request mode.</p>

<a name="2.4"><h2>2.4 Slaves</h2>

<p>Boards that are capable of being controlled over the IEEE Std 1000 Bus are
designated slaves. Slaves decode the address lines and act upon the
command provided by the current master. A slave may be combined with
other functional elements on a board (for example, a board that
contains both a master and memory that is accessible by other masters
within the system).</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows one possible system configuration that utilizes a variety of
boards in combination.</p>

<a name="3"><h1>3. Signal Lines</h1>

<p>This section provides specific definitions for all signal lines that are
part of the IEEE Std 1000 Bus. Each of these signals has been
assigned to one of five functional groups. These groups are</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Information Lines</p>

	<ol type="a">
<LI><p>Address Lines</p></li>
<LI><p>Data Lines</p></li>
<LI><p>Command Lines</p></li>

<li><p>Utility Lines</p></li>

</ol>

<a name="3.1"><h2>3.1 Information Lines</h2>

<a name="3.1.1"><h3>3.1.1 Address Lines (A[19..0])</h3>

<p>These unidirectional lines specify the address of the referenced memory or
I/O location or, during a <I>vector fetch </I>response to an
attention request, the level of the request being acknowledged. The
most significant bit is A19 and A0 is the least significant.</p>

<p>The following table details the usage of the address lines during various
types of operations.</p>

<a name="3.1.2"><h3>3.1.2 Data Lines (D[7..0])</h3>

<p>These eight bidirectional lines carry information between masters and
slaves. The most significant bit is D7 and D0 is the least
significant.</p>

<a name="3.1.3"><h3>3.1.3 Command Lines (CM[2..0])</h3>

<p>These signals are used by the current master to convey coded data to the
slave describing the type of the current data transfer according to
Table 1.</p>

<p>Command codes marked <I>reserved</I> shall not be used,
and IEEE Std 1000 boards shall not respond to or utilize these codes
for any purpose so as to be considered in compliance with this
standard. This is to guarantee compatibility with boards that may be
designed to conform to future revisions of this standard.</p>

<a name="3.2"><h2>3.2 Synchronization Lines</h2>

<p>The following signals are classified as synchronization lines:</p>

<a name="3.2.1"><h3>3.2.1 Address Strobe (ADRSTB*)</h3>

<p>This signal indicates the presence of valid data on the address lines.</p>

<a name="3.2.2"><h3>3.2.2 Data Strobe (DATSTB*)</h3>

<p>This signal indicates the presence of valid data on the command lines
CM[2..0]. During a read, or vector-fetch transfer, this signal indicates that
the addressed slave may place data on the data lines. During a write
transfer this signal indicates the presence of valid data on the data
lines.</p>

<a name="3.2.3"><h3>3.2.3 Data Transfer Acknowledge (DATACK*)</h3>

<p>This signal is used to indicate to the master that the command has been
performed: that data have been placed on, or accepted from, the data
lines.</p>

<a name="3.2.4"><h3>3.2.4 Transfer Error (TFRERR*)</h3>

<p>This signal may be asserted by any board to indicate an error during the
current transfer. Specific timing requirements for this signal are
detailed in Section 5 of this standard.</p>

<a name="3.3"><h2>3.3 Attention Request Lines (ATNRQ[7..0]*)</h2>

<p>These signals are configured for indicating user-specific events when a
IEEE Std 1000 Bus system is commissioned.</p>

<p>Such events may include, but are not limited to, interrupt requests, DMA
requests, or notification of conditions, which exist either at the
board or system level (for example, failure). Eight attention request
lines are available. Three optional response protocols are described
in Section 6. of this standard for the use of attention request lines
as traditional interrupts.</p>

<p>These signals may be used by any board to request the attention of other
boards within IEEE Std 1000 Bus systems.</p>

<p>Any board within the system may be connected to any of the eight
attention request lines. Multiple boards may be connected to the same
attention request line allowing for the broadcast of events to one or
more boards within a system. There is an implied priority with
ATNRQ0* having highest priority and ATNRQ7* having the lowest.</p>

<a name="3.4"><h2>3.4 Bus Allocation Lines</h2>

<p>The bus allocation lines are:</p>

<tr><td>ADRSTB*</td><td>Address strobe</td></tr>
<tr><td>DATSTB*</td><td>Data strobe</td></tr>
<tr><td>DATACK*</td><td>Data transfer acknowledge</td></tr>
<tr><td>TFRERR*</td><td>Transfer error</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="3.4.1"><h3>3.4.1 Bus Request Lines (BUSRQ[1..0]*)</h3>

<p>These signals may be asserted by any potential master that desires
allocation of the IEEE Std 1000 Bus. In systems utilizing prioritized
arbitration, BUSRQ0* shall have priority over BUSRQ1*.</p>

<a name="3.4.2"><h3>3.4.2 Bus Acknowledge Lines (BUSAK[1..0]*)</h3>

<p>These signals are used by the arbiter to indicate to a master requesting
bus allocation that it may take control of the bus. BUSAK1* indicates
a grant to the master requesting by way of BUSRQ1*, and BUSAK0*
indicates a grant to the master requesting by way of BUSRQ0*.</p>

<a name="3.5"><h2>3.5 Utility Lines</h2>

<p>The following signals are classified as utility lines:</p>

<a name="3.5.1"><h3>3.5.1 System Clock (SYSCLK)</h3>

<p>The
system clock is a periodic signal of constant frequency that may be
used as a generalized facility by masters or slaves. The system clock
is independent of the protocol of any other bus signals, and is
provided by the system controller. Figure 2 contains timing waveforms
for SYSCLK.</p>

<a name="3.5.2"><h3>3.5.2 System Reset (SYSRST*)</h3>

<p>The system reset signal is used to place the system in a known initial
state. While SYSRST* is active all boards shall inhibit any access to
the system bus. SYSRST* may be driven by any board. It is recommended
that during a powerup sequence, any board capable of performing
on-board diagnostic self-tests hold SYSRST* active until the
successful completion of such tests.</p>

<p>The system controller shall provide an initial power-on system reset
signal that is not &lt;200 ms and not &gt;500 ms in duration,
measured from the point at which the +5&nbsp;V dc supply reaches its
designated minimum specification (see Section 7). The system
controller also shall assert SYSRST* at any time that the system
supply falls below its minimum specified tolerance, and shall
continue to assert it for the entire period during which the supply
is out of tolerance. The rise time of this signal shall not exceed
100 ns (10%-90%).</p>

<p>A recommended power-fail protocol, for implementation of systems where
an early indication of primary power supply failure is available, is
provided in Section 7.</p>

<a name="4"><h1>4. Arbitration</h1>

<p>This section defines the protocol that is used by IEEE Std 1000 Bus
masters to gain control of the IEEE Std 1000 Bus.</p>

<p>The following signals are used to effect allocation of bus control within IEEE Std 1000 Bus systems:</p>

<p>BUSRQ [1..0]*</p>

<p>BUSAK [1..0]*</p>

<a name="4.1"><h2>4.1 Arbitration Algorithm</h2>

<p>On power-up, or following a system reset, the arbiter shall have control
of the bus. All masters (except default masters) must request and
receive a control allocation grant from the arbiter prior to
controlling the bus. Only the arbiter may effect a change in
allocation of bus control within an IEEE Std 1000 Bus system.</p>

<p>Any
algorithm may be used by the arbiter to determine which of the bus
request levels will be granted when the current master releases the
bus, although, by convention, the BUSRQ0*/BUSAK0*, request/grant pair
have priority over BUSRQ1*/BUSAK1*. The arbiter may award preference
to one requesting level on a priority basis, a round-robin basis, or
by means of any other algorithm implementable within the control
transfer protocol.</p>

<a name="4.2"><h2>4.2 Bus Requests</h2>

<p>A Bus request may be initiated by any master within an IEEE Std 1000
Bus system at any time by asserting one of the BUSRQ* lines. Bus

indicated by the relative voltage level present on a BUSRQ<I>n</I> line
rather than by the active transition from one state to another.</p>

assert it for the entire period during which it desires to control
the bus.</p>

asserting one of the BUSRQ* lines except that a master may not assert
BUSRQ<I>n</I>*
until the corresponding BUSAK<I>n</I>*

<p>The arbiter, upon detecting BUSRQ<I>n</I>*
active, and having first assured that the bus is available, shall assert BUSAK<I>n</I>
indicating that the bus is available for use by the requesting master. The
arbiter shall not assert BUSAK<I>n</I>*
in the absence of a corresponding BUSRQ<I>n</I>*. The bus is available for arbitration if the arbiter is not issuing a
bus grant to any master, either by asserting BUSAK<I>n</I>*
or by granting to the bus to its own on-board master (if one is
present).</p>

<p>The requesting master, upon detecting that BUSAK<I>n</I>*
has been made active, shall assume control of the bus.</p>

<p>Upon completing the desired data transfer sequences, the current master
shall cease driving all bus lines and shall then release BUSRQ<I>n</I>*.</p>

<p>The arbiter, upon detecting that the BUSRQ<I>n</I>*
is no longer asserted, shall release BUSAK<I>n</I>*.</p>

<a name="5"><h1>5. Data Transfer Protocol</h1>

<p>This section defines the protocol and timing requirements necessary to
effect data transfer sequences across the IEEE Std 1000 Bus. All data
are transferred as single bytes using an asynchronous interlocked
handshake. The asynchronous nature of the protocol allows
communication between masters and slaves of widely differing speeds,
and is essentially self-adaptive to changing system configurations.</p>

<p>Indivisible read-modify-write sequences are accommodated within the protocol,
allowing synchronization of tasks in a multiple processor system by
use of lock variables.</p>

<p>A high-speed <I>burst </I>mode of data transfer is also specified, 
allowing for rapid movement of contiguous data blocks between boards.</p>

<p>Figure 6 illustrates the various types of sequences accommodated by the IEEE
Std 1000 Bus data transfer protocol.</p>

<p>The signals used for data transfer sequences are</p>

<p>Throughout this section the word master implies current master, that is, it is
assumed that the master discussed has been allocated control of the
IEEE Std 1000 Bus by means of the protocol described in Section 4 of
this standard.</p>

<a name="6"><h1>6. Inter-Board Signaling</h1>

<a name="6.1"><h2>6.1 Overview</h2>

<p>To enable IEEE Std 1000 Bus systems to perform optimally in real-time
applications, to respond effectively to error conditions, and to
support techniques for rapid movement of blocks of data, a set of
eight attention request lines are provided. These lines allow
signaling between boards that is essentially unrelated to, and
independent of the data transfer protocol, otherwise used to effect
inter-board communications.</p>

<p>The attention request lines are provided to allow a board to alert one or
more other boards of the occurrence of some event that requires a
change in flow or context of the current system activity. The event
may be a need for service as in the case of a traditional <I>interrupt</I>,
a need for DMA transfer, an error condition at the system-level (for
example, power failure), an error condition at the board-level (for
example, parity failure) or any other system-specific or
time-critical event.</p>

<p>Figure 14 shows a typical implementation of the attention request lines. This section details the usage of the attention request lines, and
the corresponding protocols that are utilized within IEEE Std 1000 Bus systems for specialized interboard communication.</p>

<p>The signal lines are</p>

<p>An attention request is initiated by a board asserting one of the eight
attention request lines. A request may be used to gain the attention
of one or more other boards. Any board may be connected to any of the
eight request lines, and multiple boards may be connected to the same
request line. In this way requests or status flags may be <I>broadcast
</I>on a global level within a system.</p>

<p>Requests are level-triggered, meaning that a requesting condition is indicated
by the relative voltage level present on any request line rather than
by the active transition of the signal from one state to another.</p>

<p>It is recommended that boards capable of asserting an ATNRQn* line are
designed in such a way that it is possible to disable or reassign the
signal to any other ATNRQn* line, and that boards capable of
responding to attention requests are designed in such a way that it
is possible to inhibit or reassign an incoming ATNRQn* signal to any
of its request inputs.</p>

<a name="6.2.1"><h3>6.2.1 Attention Request Priority</h3>

<p>Boards
requesting attention within an IEEE Std 1000 Bus system may be
assigned a priority for response. The attention request lines are
assigned a priority with ATNRQ0* having the highest priority and
ATNRQ7* having the lowest priority.</p>

<p>In general the priority schemes utilized within a given system are
system specific and will depend on the chosen function of each
attention request line and the way in which specific functions are
allocated to each attention request line. However, it is recommended
that, in systems utilizing these lines for both DMA requests and
interrupt (or other) requests, ATNRQ[3..0[*
should be utilized for interrupt requests and ATNRQ[7..4]
* for DMA requests.</p>

<p>It is not implied that interrupt requests, DMA request, or any other
requests must participate in any larger priority scheme where one
group of functional uses of attention request lines has priority over
any other. Rather, it is assumed that several priority schemes may
exist, which may or may not be related to one another, and which may
be user assigned according to specific system requirements.</p>

<a name="6.3"><h2>6.3 Response to Interrupt Attention Requests</h2>

<p>A master receiving an interrupt by way of an attention request line may
respond in one of three ways</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>Implicit	response</p>
<LI><p>Explicit response</p>
<LI><p>Local action response</p>
</OL>

<a name="6.3.1"><h3>6.3.1 Implicit Response</h3>

<p>An implicit response to an attention request is where a master uses one
or more read or read-modify-write data transfer sequences
to discover which device within a system is requesting attention (if
necessary), and subsequently uses either a read, write, or 
read-modify-write data transfer sequence to
acknowledge to the board requesting attention that its request
has been granted and that the requesting device must release the
attention request line.</p>

<a name="6.3.2"><h3>6.3.2 Explicit Response</h3>

<p>An explicit response to an attention request is where a master uses the
vector-fetch data transfer sequence to discover which
device within a system is requesting attention, and to simultaneously
acknowledge to the board requesting attention
that its request has been granted and that the requesting device may
release the attention request line. The specific
protocol of the vector-fetch sequence shall conform to the following
description:</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>The master places the number of the attention request line that it is
responding to on address lines A[2..0],
according to the following table:</p>


<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>A2</th><th>A1</th><th>A0</th><th>Acknowledged Line</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>ATNRQ0*</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>ATNRQ1*</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>ATNRQ2*</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>ATNRQ6*</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>ATNRQ7*</td></tr>
</table>

<LI><p>After a setup time, during which the address lines become valid, the
	master shall assert ADRSTB*.</p>

<LI><p>The master shall activate the command lines, CM[2..0],
	to indicate a vector-fetch transfer.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>CM2</th><th>CM1</th><th>CM0</th><th>Transfer</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td>Vector-fetch</td></tr>
</table>

<LI><p>After a setup time during which the command lines become valid, the
	master shall assert DATSTB* indicating the presence of valid data on
	the command lines, and that it is ready to accept data.</p>

<LI><p>The requesting device, upon decoding the address lines shall enable
	its data bus drivers, placing its unique identifying vector on the
	data lines.</p>

<LI><p>After a setup time, during which the data lines become valid, the
	requesting boards shall assert DATACK* indicating that the vector
	data is available.</p>

<LI><p>In response to DATACK* the master shall accept the vector data and
	shall release ADRSTB* and DATSTB*, indicating to the requesting
	device that it must remove the vector data from the data lines, and
	that it may release the attention request line.</p>

<LI><p>Upon detecting either DATSTB* or ADRSTB* released, the requesting
	board disables its data bus drivers and releases DATACK* indicating
	that the sequence is complete.</p>

</OL>

<p>Multiple bytes of vector data may be transferred by use of the burst-mode data
transfer protocol.</p>

<p>Boards capable of supplying vector data to an explicit response, by way of a
vector-fetch data transfer sequence, shall also be capable of
supplying the same information to an implicit response.</p>

<p>The scheme that is used by an IEEE Std 1000 Bus master to locate the
interrupt service routine that relates specifically to the
transferred vector is specific to the CPU device used and is beyond
the scope of this standard.</p>

<p>Masters capable of explicit response to interrupts by way of attention
request lines shall also be capable of implicit response.</p>

<a name="6.3.3"><h3>6.3.3 Local Action Response</h3>

<p>A local action response is where a board receiving an interrupt by way
of an attention request line does not acknowledge the board
requesting attention but performs some kind of operation locally in
response to the request. A local action response is typically used
when error conditions, such as power failure indication, are
broadcast by way of attention request lines.</p>

<a name="6.4"><h2>6.4 Excluded Utilizations of Attention Request Lines</h2>

<p>For any board to be considered IEEE Std 1000 Bus compatible, it shall
remain in compliance with all parts of this standard in the absence
of any signal applied to any ATNRQn* line. Note that while the
performance of a given board may be seriously impaired in such
absence, the operation of other IEEE Std 1000 Bus boards shall in no
way be impaired whether such signals are absent or not. This
stipulation is made to specifically exclude the use of ATNRQn* lines
for implementing signals, which are processor or device-specific,
generally synchronous in nature, and which may preclude the use of
that board with any other board otherwise designed in accordance with
this standard.</p>

<a name="7"><h1>7. Electrical Specifications</h1>

<p>This section specifies the electrical characteristics for IEEE Std 1000
Bus compatible boards and power supplies.</p>

<p>Recommendations are also given for compatible backplanes and termination networks.</p>



<p>The IEEE Std 1000 Bus provides an environment for the supply of dc power
to boards and the transmission of digital logic signals between
boards within a single subrack, on a single backplane that provides
the following features:</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>Distribution of primary dc power using four pins on each connector for each of
	the +5&nbsp;V and 0&nbsp;V dc supplies.</p>

<LI><p>Distribution of both negative and positive auxiliary supplies
	utilizing 1 pin per supply on each connector.</p>

<LI><p>Distribution of a stand-by power supply that uses 1 pin on each
	connector.</p>

<LI><p>Forty-nine controlled impedance signal lines, which are normally
	terminated at both ends of the backplane.</p>

<LI><p>Four 0&nbsp;V ac return lines each using 1 pin, which are embedded within
	the signal set as backplane guard tracks.</p>

<LI><p>A maximum length for any signal line of 500&nbsp;mm (20 in), including
	connection to the termination networks.</p>

<LI><p>Provision for a maximum of 21 boards at a preferred horizontal pitch
	of 20.32&nbsp;mm (0.8 in).</p>
</OL>

<p>All boards conforming to the IEEE Std 1000 Bus standard shall adhere to
the electrical specifications detailed in this section. These
specifications are provided to create a reliable environment for
boards to operate within, minimizing the problems of noise and
crosstalk, and providing a defined time interval for signals to
become valid after they initially become active.</p>

<p>These specifications do not require the use of any particular semiconductor
technology, and circuitry implemented in any technology that meets
these specifications is acceptable.</p>

<a name="7.1"><h2>7.1 Power Supplies</h2>

<p>This subsection details the requirements, and makes additional
recommendations, to aid the system designer (or integrator) in the
choice of power supplies and the proper distribution of system power.</p>

<p>The +5&nbsp;V logic supply is the primary power source within a system and
will normally have the largest current requirement. No board shall
require a maximum current that exceeds 4 A from this supply. Power
supply distribution design shall be such that there is no voltage
drop in the power distribution system, which results in the voltage
available at any particular board being outside the limits of this
specification.</p>

<p>The auxiliary (&plusmn;12&nbsp;V) voltage power supply units shall not be required to provide
greater than 1 A from each supply by any one board within the system.</p>

<p>The standby supply specification provides for the distribution of backup
power to boards within a system that requires power during periods
when the primary system supply cannot be maintained. A board shall
not require greater than 1 A current from this supply. In systems
that do not require this supply, provision should be made for
connecting this line to the +5&nbsp;V logic supply.</p>

<p>The power supply sense point, if used, should be at the first point of
connection of the power supply to the backplane.</p>

<a name="7.1.1"><h3>7.1.1 Supply Tolerances</h3>

<p>Table 3 specifies the power supply requirements for IEEE Std 1000 Bus
systems. Variation is the tolerance from the nominal specified
voltage, as measured at any board position on the backplane through
the connector, that is,</p>

<p>Variation = distribution + line regulation + load regulation</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>Distribution is the voltage loss caused by the power distribution system that consists of:</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>The backplane resistance.</p>

<LI><p>The power supply to backplane interconnect scheme when the voltage is
sensed by the power supply at other than the connection point of the
power supply to the backplane.</p>

<LI><p>Line Regulation and Load Regulation are as defined by the manufacturer of
a particular power supply, according to a specified set of test
conditions. These conditions should be specified in such a manner as
to allow for a reliable calculation of the overall performance,
which may be achieved within an actual system environment.</p>


<p><h>Table 3 &mdash; Power Supply and Distribution</h></p>

<a name="7.6.1"><h3>7.6.1 Transmission-Line Environment</h3>

<p>All signal lines should be considered as transmission lines so as to
reliably transmit high-speed digital information. For the
purpose of calculation of the parameters of this environment, the
following items apply:</p>

<OL>
<LI><p>The maximum length of any signal line on the backplane shall not exceed 500&nbsp;mm (19.7&nbsp;in).</p>
<LI><p>The minimum separation between connectors shall be 20.32&nbsp;mm (0.8&nbsp;in).</p>

<p>The IEEE Std 1000 Bus is designed to take into account the driving
requirements of high-performance transmission-line backplanes. The
transmission-line system, together with the specified maximum signal
length, allow an accurate determination of the time required for a
signal to be correctly received.</p>

<p>Backplanes should be designed using only microstrips for the signal lines, and
should provide an unloaded characteristic impedance of 60&nbsp;&Omega;&nbsp;&plusmn;10% 
including the effects of plated through holes and connectors.</p>

<p>Backplane signal tracks should have a constant width throughout the length of
the backplane so as to keep the same characteristic impedance
throughout its length.</p>

<p>Groundplanes are required so as to form a well-defined transmission-line
environment. All groundplanes shall be continuous, allowing breaks in
